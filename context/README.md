# Configuration

Apart from database passwords, all configuration for the stack is defined in `./context/context.json`.

The purpose of most properties is evident in the name. However, supplementary explanation as follows:

- **stack.Tags:** All resources created will automatically be tagged with the 3 tags set here.
- **scheduleRateHours:** In an effort to reduce costs, CDC will not be left running, but will only be re-engaged at a set interval and stop after a specific period of time. This is performed by a lambda function triggered by an eventbridge rule configured with this interval setting.
- **oracleSubnetIds:** The IDs of subnets that the source Oracle database operates in.
- **postgresInstanceSize:** It is assumed that you are testing and want to create a PostGres RDS database in the same subnet as the source Oracle database to simplify connectivity and network access. This setting is optional, but if set, will trigger the creation of a small RDS instance for PostGres.
- **postgresInstanceIngress:** Comes into play if **postgresInstanceSize** is set. The items in this listing are used to configure the ingress rules for the target PostGres database.
- **postgresPassword:** The password for the target PostGres database. Can only be used if the PostGres database is NOT hosted by the RDS service *(ie: resides on campus)*. Nonetheless, use of this property is discouraged in favor of secrets manager, and is only intended if your PostGres database is being hosted on your machine *(localhost)*.
- **publicSubnetIds:** Comes into play if **postgressInstanceSize** is set. These are the subnets that the DMS replication will operate in. 
  IMPORTANT: These must be public subnets (have routes to an internet gateway), else the DMS service will not be able to communicate with secrets manager to acquire database passwords.
